# üîê Task 01: Caesar Cipher Program  
**SkillCraft Technology Cyber Security Internship**

---

## üìò Overview
This project is part of my internship at **@SkillCraft Technology**. I built a **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption program using Python. Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ Encrypt and decrypt messages with a user-defined shift  
‚úÖ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters  
‚úÖ Preserves punctuation, special characters, and spaces  
‚úÖ Simple, console-based interface  
‚úÖ Easy-to-understand code with full documentation

---

## üß† Concepts Used

- ASCII manipulation (`ord()`, `chr()`)
- Modulo arithmetic for wrap-around effect
- String handling in Python
- Conditional logic for encryption & decryption

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- Code editor or terminal access

```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

### üîê Encryption
Each letter is shifted by `n` positions:
```
Plaintext:  HELLO
Shift:      +3
Encrypted:  KHOOR
```

### üîì Decryption
Reverse the shift to get original text:
```
Encrypted:  KHOOR
Shift:      -3
Plaintext:  HELLO
```

### üåê Sample Interaction
```bash
Welcome to Caesar Cipher Program üîê

Choose an option:
1. Encrypt Text
2. Decrypt Text
3. Exit

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter message to encrypt: Hello World!
Enter shift value (e.g., 3): 5
‚úÖ Encrypted message: Mjqqt Btwqi!
```
